# Project-1
Directions:Â¶
This is the second part of Project #1.
Objective: Using Python, what insights can be drawn from the Course Survey data to help increase the number of students (any group) taking computing classes?
Start with your cleaned data from the previous Data Cleaning exercise. Then, document in a Jupyter Notebook four findings that can help guide the recruiting or messaging efforts. Documentation should include codes, plots, and comments (using Markdown cells). Code output and plots should clearly show your findings.
Questions to consider: These are just some questions to consider. Feel free to explore the data in any avenue to come up with your four insights. There is a lot of rich data in these survey results, which could be analyzed in many ways. In your analysis, be sure to focus on the problem, which is to learn from these students to know what brought them to the course, so that we can attract others and learn from the non-majors why and what their interests are in computing.
Are there groups of students who express an interest in another computing class? If so, who are they? How can they be categorized?
What are the best methods for reaching out to students? How did most students hear about a computing class?
What can you learn from the non-majors taking the computing entry-level classes (CMPs 128, 120, 239, etc.)?
What can you learn from the students in the computer literacy courses and what are the interests they may or may not have in computing?
Submit:
A link to your GitHub repository that contains:
Jupyter Notebook showing your explorations and conclusions:
  - Markdown cells should be used to describe the problem and organize and explain your notebook.
  - Python code must be commented.
